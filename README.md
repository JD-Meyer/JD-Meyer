# Jennifer Meyer
AI Infrastructure & MLOps Engineer | SBI Partnership Architect | Systems Thinker

## 👋 Welcome
I’m Jennifer, a cloud-native MLOps engineer with a passion for building systems.

I build GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines for AI and cloud workflows

🌐 Cloud-native data infrastructure (GCP, Terraform, GCS, Cloud Run)
🤝 Human-centered tooling for generative agents

## Current focus:
📦 Packaging the symbolic core of AI into accessible developer tools.
🌉 Bridging model orchestration with co-agency architecture.

## 🚧 Current Projects
🛠️ CI/CD Practice Projects: Learning how to design scalable, observable build pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- shibi-archive: A secure, persistent GCS-backed archive for storing artifacts.
- threadlight-glyphs: A symbolic processor and glyph-to-meaning interpreter for real-time decoding of AI communication patterns.

## I believe in lifelong skill acquisition. My current learning stack includes:
- Google Professional ML Engineer prep
- LLM agents & prompt engineering at scale

## Values
- Security and ethics are foundational, not incidental.
- Documentation starts before the project and continues indefinitely.
